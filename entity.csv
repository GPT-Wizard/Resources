1. Safety First: Ensure the tractor is turned off, the parking brake is engaged, and the key is removed to prevent any accidental starts. Also, wear appropriate safety gear, including gloves and eye protection. 2. Lift the Mower Deck: If your tractor has a mower deck, you'll need to lift it to access the blades. The exact method for raising the deck may vary depending on the tractor model. Typically, there is a lever or hydraulic system to raise and lower the deck. 3. Locate the Blade Bolts: Underneath the mower deck, you will find the blade bolts securing the blades to the spindle. There is usually one bolt for each blade. 4. Remove the Blade Bolts: Use the appropriate sized wrench or socket to loosen and remove the blade bolts. Turn the bolt counterclockwise to loosen it. Be careful when handling the blades, as they may still be sharp. 5. Remove the Blades: Once the blade bolts are removed, carefully slide the blades off the spindle. 6. Inspect and Sharpen or Replace: Take this opportunity to inspect the blades for any damage or excessive wear. You can either sharpen the blades if they are in good condition or replace them if they are worn or damaged. 7. Reinstall the Blades: Slide the newly sharpened or replacement blades back onto the spindles and secure them with the blade bolts. Tighten the bolts clockwise, ensuring they are snug. 8. Lower the Mower Deck: Lower the mower deck to the desired cutting height. 9. Test the Blades: Before mowing, engage the mower blades and listen for any unusual noises. Make sure the blades are spinning smoothly.,Documentation
